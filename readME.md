# Walmart Sales Analysis

This project provides a data analysis of Walmart sales, exploring various factors that may impact weekly sales performance across different stores. By analyzing trends in sales, holiday impacts, fuel prices, unemployment, temperature, and the Consumer Price Index (CPI), this project aims to uncover insights that could drive business decisions.

## Dataset

The dataset includes information on weekly sales from multiple Walmart stores, along with variables such as:

- **Store**: Unique store number.
- **Date**: Weekly date.
- **Weekly_Sales**: Sales revenue for each store on a weekly basis.
- **Holiday_Flag**: Indicator for whether the week includes a holiday (1 = holiday week, 0 = non-holiday week).
- **Temperature**: Average weekly temperature.
- **Fuel_Price**: Average fuel price for the week.
- **CPI**: Consumer Price Index.
- **Unemployment**: Weekly unemployment rate.

## Objective

The goal of this project is to perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the Walmart sales dataset and to answer key questions that can provide insights for retail performance and strategy. 

## Key Analysis Questions

1. **Holiday Impact on Sales**: Do holiday weeks significantly affect weekly sales?
2. **Store Performance**: Which stores perform best and which perform worst in terms of sales?
3. **Temperature and Sales Relationship**: Is there a correlation between temperature changes and weekly sales?
4. **Economic Factors**: How do fuel prices, CPI, and unemployment rates correlate with sales?
5. **Top and Bottom Sales Weeks**: What are the highest and lowest sales weeks overall and by individual store?
6. **Impact of CPI on Sales**: Does a change in CPI influence weekly sales performance?
